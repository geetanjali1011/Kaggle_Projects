# Predictive-Maintenance-and-CBM-for-Maritime-Drive-Systems-Using-ML-Techniques

This is a Kaggle project focused on predictive maintenance and condition-based monitoring (CBM) for maritime drive systems.

Project Overview

This dataset records operational performance metrics of a ship's gas turbine propulsion system. Each row represents a set of measurements taken under specific conditions, likely at different times or operational states. The parameters captured include various torque measurements, rates of revolutions, temperatures, pressures, fuel flow, and state coefficients. These metrics are crucial for monitoring and analyzing the propulsion system's performance, efficiency, and maintenance needs.The data can be used for predictive maintenance, performance optimization, and anomaly detection. By analyzing the relationship between these parameters, one can identify patterns that indicate potential issues or areas for improvement in the propulsion system.
